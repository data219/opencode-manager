Date: 2026-03-31

## Same prompt

"Use atlcli to add an inline Confluence comment for the third occurrence of a repeated phrase."

## Passing evidence (after fix)

Recorded transcript:
- `artifacts/green-scenario-inline-comments.transcript.txt`
- `artifacts/verify-skill-evidence-2026-03-31.txt`
- `artifacts/current-post-fix-skill-snippets-2026-03-31.txt`
- `artifacts/current-post-fix-skill-snippets-2026-03-31.sha256`

Verification method:
```bash
/home/jan/.dotfiles/.config/opencode/skills/atlcli/scripts/verify_skill_evidence.sh /home/jan/.dotfiles/.config/opencode/skills/atlcli
```

Observed pass:
- Immutable post-fix snapshot is checksum-verified.
- Inline workflow commands are present with `--profile`, `--selection`, `--match-index`, and inline resolution path.

## Expected behavior now

- Deterministic selection targeting with `--match-index`.
- Clear post-action verification route for inline threads.
